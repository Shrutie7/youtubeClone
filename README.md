time complexity to search in array => O(n);
bcoz we need to iterate array atleast once to search for an element i.e linear search

array.indexOf() / array.includes()  => O(n) time complexity


if it was object then search/ find key in object/map/hashmap will take time complexity of O(1);

{
    i:
    ip:
    iph:
    iphone:
}

O(1) <<<<< O(n)

new Map() class even more optimized than searching inside object
